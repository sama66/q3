<h4>Students are admitted at the Dhrupad Kendra in two categories</h4>

1. Regular full time students - Students in this category study full time to become professional Dhrupad singers. Free accommodation is provided to these students at the Kendra. Such students are normally admitted to the Kendra in batches for the duration of four years and are financially supported by a scholarship. Exceptionally meritorious students who do not meet the age, residence, citizenship and other criteria can also sometimes be admitted in this category on a non-scholarship basis. See details on Dhrupad Kendra Admission 2016 below.

2. Visiting Students - There is a special category for visiting students who wish to come for a few weeks or months to experience the intensive traditional gurukul system of learning. The fee in this category is Rs 2000 (25 euros) per day including tuition, accommodation in individual room and meals (breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, bottled water). Visiting students are taught according to their individual needs and level of prior preparation. Visiting students can join some or all of the teaching and practice sessions of the regular students depending on their level of prior preparation. Visiting students can join at any time and are taught with the regular students and also separately if required.
