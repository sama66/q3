**Efforts to notate and publish Dhrupad compositions started in the 19th Century when printing came to India.** Dhrupad singers tried to notate and preserve compositions - the fixed repertoire of Dhrupad that encapsulated the musical knowledge and wisdom of many generations of Dhrupadiyas. Many of the manuscripts were only partly or never published. Some remained in private hands of descendants zealously guarded from the public and eventually lost or destroyed. With most of the repertoire of compositions of Dhrupad now lost or fragmented and distorted, it is a work of great importance to try to save whatever survives of books and unpublished manuscripts. Dhrupad singers who are traditionally trained and steeped in the knowledge of tradition can then use their training to reconstruct repair and restore compositions that have been distorted or lost and bring them back to life. I have over the last 30 years tried to collect and digitize published and unpublished works with my own resources and hope that a well funded initiative can be launched to carry out this task on a war footing. Below is a partial list of books I managed to digitize.

Search and digitization of rare works requires funds and donations supporting the work are welcome. Raw digital images of pages of copyright expired works available at 0.50 euro cents per page minimum 200 pages. (No Discounts possible). Proceeds will be used to finance the search for and digitization of more rare works on Dhrupad.

**Sangeet Samuccaya**{:.book} 1924 complied and edited by Shivendranath Basu A compilation of notations of compositions of mainly Dhrupad in various Ragas. The first volume has 72 compositions. The author writes that he has collected over a 1000 compositions and also instrumental Gats and pakhawaj compositions which he hopes to publish in the future. The back cover of the first volume mentions that the second volume is being printed. However it was probably never printed.

**Sangeet Kaladhar**{:.book} 1901 by Dahyalal Shivram state musician of Bhavnagar. Has notations of many compositions of Dhrupad in the Gujarati script.

**Raga Kalpadrum**{:.book} 1916 (3 volumes) - the magnum opus of Krishnanand Vyas with a near exhaustive listing of the texts of Dhrupad and Khyal compositions. Invaluable for the work of removing distortions in compositions and also in reconstructing lost parts of compositions.

**Geet Vadya Sar Sangraha**{:.book} 1905- by Charucharan Mukhopadhyaya A collection of 250 compositions of Dhrupad in notation. The author writes about a soon to be published 2nd volume which again like in most cases never got printed.

**Sangeet Chandrika**{:.book} by Gopeshwar Banerjee,  written in the early years of the 20th century by the renowned Dhrupad singer of Vishnupur Gopeshwar Bannerjee. Contains many  Dhrupad compositions in the danda matrik  system of notation that is superior to what is commonly found in India, because it makes provision for half and quarter  notes. In the later editions the danda matrik notation has been changed to the Bhatkhande system. The compositions sound authentic, and are free from distortions that are common in most published works. This is  probably because the author was himself a highly respected Dhrupad singer.

**Sangeet Manjari**{:.book} 1909, 1935 by Ramprasanna Banerjee the elder brother of Gopeshwar Bannerjee. Like the Sangeet Chandrika has many beautiful compositions. Again free from distortions since the author was a highly respected Dhrupad singer. The book is in the more accurate danda matrik notation.
